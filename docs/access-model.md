# Access Model

Nature Grid should be useful before login. The public site is not only a marketing page; it is a single-page public environmental board with summaries, maps, alerts, verified reports, biodiversity highlights, restoration work, and community activity.

## Public Without Login

The root web page `/` should show a complete public overview:

- mission and platform purpose
- national/environmental dashboard metrics
- public map preview
- active public alerts
- recent verified reports
- biodiversity highlights
- restoration project highlights
- public dataset summaries
- community campaigns and education highlights
- calls to action for sign in, report submission, contribution, and advanced data access

Public users can browse and understand what is happening, but sensitive actions and deep data access are gated.
