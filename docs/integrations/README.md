# Third-Party Data Sources

Nature Grid keeps one source note per external data provider. These files document what is fetched, where it is stored, how often it syncs, and what is intentionally not covered yet.

| Source | Status | Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [OpenMeteo](openmeteo.md) | Implemented | Weather forecasts and air quality for Bangladesh districts |
| [OpenMeteo Climate](openmeteo-climate.md) | Implemented (operational pipeline) | 30-day rolling climate averages from forecast/AQ APIs at union level; long-range Climate API projections remain future work |
