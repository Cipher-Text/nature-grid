# Ingestion Plan

Source analysis: `open-nature/apps/backend` (partial implementation, Spring Boot) and `open-nature-backend2` (entity model only). This document captures what was learned and translates it into a concrete NestJS/Prisma plan for nature-grid. No Java code will be ported — logic and patterns will be re-implemented in TypeScript.

---

## Implementation status (2026-08-16)

OpenMeteo weather, air quality, and Flood ingestion are **done**, but with a smaller, redesigned scope than this document originally planned. GBIF ingestion is also implemented in the separate `biodiversity` module. Read this before treating the sections below as current:

| Planned (this doc) | Actually built | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module at `apps/api/src/ingestion/` with `clients/`, `schedulers/`, `services/` subfolders | Self-contained `apps/api/src/weather/` module (client, service, scheduler, controller — 4 files, no subfolders) | Only one provider (OpenMeteo) was in scope; the split wasn't earning its keep yet. `ingestion/` stays for future generic job bookkeeping. |
| `WeatherReading` / `AirQualityReading` (one wide table each, `rawJson` column) | `CurrentWeatherReading`, `HourlyWeatherForecast`, `DailyWeatherForecast`, `HourlyAirQuality` (4 tables, trimmed fields, no raw JSON) | Current/hourly/daily have different fetch cadences and shapes; splitting them avoids one table with mostly-null columns depending on reading type. |
| `WeatherAggregate` / `AqiAggregate` daily rollups | Not built | No consumer needed rollups yet; raw hourly/daily rows are queried directly. Revisit if retention or dashboard needs arise. |
| `ApiCallLog` — every external HTTP call logged | Not built | Deliberately skipped for this pass — failures are logged via NestJS `Logger` only. `AuditEvent` exists generically if this is wanted later. |
| Proximity/radius-based location matching (`WeatherDataAccessServiceImpl` pattern from `open-nature`) | Direct `districtId` foreign key on every weather row | Every fetch already targets a known district, so matching by FK is simpler and exact — no haversine distance queries needed. |
| District lat/lng: "hardcode divisional capitals first" (open question) | All 64 districts backfilled with real coordinates from `open-nature`'s `district.csv` | The source data was already available and reusable — no need for a placeholder step. |
| Resilience4j-equivalent circuit breaker | Manual 3-attempt retry with fixed backoff, no circuit breaker | Trimmed for MVP; per-district failures are caught and logged without tripping the whole scheduler run. |
| Read endpoints at `/ingestion/weather/latest` | `/weather/current`, `/weather/hourly/:districtId`, `/weather/daily/:districtId`, `/weather/air-quality` | Endpoints live under the module that owns the data. |

The gap analysis, API research, and "what NOT to port" sections below are still useful background, but provider-specific facts now live in `docs/integrations/`. The concrete implementation plan (models, module structure, tasks) has been superseded for OpenMeteo and GBIF.

## What the Java backends established

### open-nature (partially implemented)

| Component | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenMeteo HTTP client | Done | Reactive WebClient, 60+ parameters, 4 fetch types |
| Resilience4j circuit breaker | Done | Sliding window 10, 50% failure threshold, 30s open |
| Retry with backoff | Done | 3 attempts, 2s base, 1.5x multiplier |
| Spring scheduler | Done | Hourly current, 2h hourly/AQ, 12h daily |
| ApiResponseLog entity | Done | All API calls logged with timing, error, correlation ID |
| OpenMeteo data → DB persistence | **Not done** | TODO comment in scheduler — fetch works, save does not |
| District stats aggregation | Partial | Service exists, has no source data yet |
| Air quality → DB persistence | **Not done** | Same issue |

### open-nature-backend2 (entity model only)

Added these well-designed entities not yet in nature-grid:
- `WeatherData` — full time-series per reading (temp, humidity, pressure, wind, precipitation, cloud, UV, AQI, raw JSON)
- `AirQualityData` — PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO, CO2, CH4, NH3, health recommendations
- `WeatherAggregate` / `AqiAggregate` — daily rollups per division/district
- `ReportMedia` — media attachments on citizen reports
- `ReportComment` — comments with nested reply support
- `RestorationProject` (SustainabilityProject) — community restoration tracking
- `CitizenProfile`, `ResearcherProfile`, `OrganizationProfile` — extended per-role profiles
- `ClimateAlert` — richer than current Alert (affected area polygon, estimated population, shelter locations)
- `ApiCallLog` — all external API calls tracked

## Third-party APIs — priority order

| Priority | API | Key | Data | Frequency | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **OpenMeteo weather** | None | Temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, UV, weather code, cloud cover | Current every 15min, hourly every 2h, daily every 12h | Implemented. See `docs/integrations/openmeteo.md`. |
| 1 | **OpenMeteo air quality** | None | PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO, UV index | Every 2h | Implemented. AQI fields are available from OpenMeteo but not requested/stored yet. See `docs/integrations/openmeteo.md`. |
| 2 | **WAQI** | Free (register) | AQI per city station, dominant pollutant, health advice | Every 1h | More station-level granularity than OpenMeteo for urban AQI |
| 3 | **GBIF** | None | Species taxonomy and occurrence records for Bangladesh | Daily | Implemented. Filter by `country=BD&hasCoordinate=true`. See `docs/integrations/gbif.md`. |
| 4 | **BMD** | Gov approval | Bangladesh Met Dept — local station weather, cyclone bulletins | As available | May require official registration. Start with OpenMeteo for coverage. |
| 5 | **FFWC** | Gov approval | Bangladesh Flood Forecasting Warning Centre — flood alerts | Real-time | `http://www.ffwc.gov.bd`. May need scraping if no public API. |

Two further sources are unscheduled:

- **iNaturalist** occurrence ingestion. `apps/api/src/datasets/seed/catalog.ts` already lists iNaturalist as a dataset source, so the catalog advertises a source with no ingestion behind it.
- **OpenWeatherMap** / **AirNow** as additional weather and AQ coverage.
- Additional OpenMeteo APIs now documented in `docs/integrations/`: Flood is implemented; Climate, Marine Weather, and Satellite Radiation remain candidates.

## Implementation design

### NestJS scheduler setup

Use `@nestjs/schedule` (cron-based, zero external dependency) for lightweight fetch jobs. BullMQ is the intended choice for jobs that need retry, concurrency control, or worker isolation — but note it is **not installed**; adding it is part of this plan, not a pre-existing capability.

```
@nestjs/schedule   → hourly/daily fetch crons (OpenMeteo, GBIF)
BullMQ (planned)   → ingestion jobs created via API (admin-triggered, retryable)
```

### HTTP client pattern

Each external API gets its own client class in `apps/api/src/ingestion/clients/`:

```
openmeteo-weather.client.ts   — current + hourly + daily
openmeteo-airquality.client.ts
waqi.client.ts
gbif.client.ts
```

Each client:
- Uses native `fetch` (Node 18+) or `axios` — no reactive wrapper needed in NestJS
- Writes an `ApiCallLog` row for every request (success or failure)
- Throws typed errors that the scheduler catches and logs
- Has a correlation ID generated per request

### Retry / resilience

No Resilience4j equivalent library needed. Implement a simple retry utility:

```typescript
// apps/api/src/ingestion/util/retry.ts
async function withRetry<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>, maxAttempts = 3, baseDelayMs = 2000): Promise<T>
```

For circuit-breaker behaviour, track consecutive failures in the `Provider.isActive` flag plus `ApiCallLog` failure counts.

### Scheduler structure (within IngestionModule)

```
ingestion/
  clients/
    openmeteo-weather.client.ts
    openmeteo-airquality.client.ts
    waqi.client.ts
    gbif.client.ts
  schedulers/
    weather.scheduler.ts       — @Cron every 1h, fetches all 64 districts
    air-quality.scheduler.ts   — @Cron every 2h
    biodiversity.scheduler.ts  — @Cron daily
  services/
    weather-ingestion.service.ts
    air-quality-ingestion.service.ts
    ingestion-job.service.ts   — manages IngestionJob records
    api-call-log.service.ts    — writes ApiCallLog rows
  ingestion.module.ts
```

### OpenMeteo parameters to fetch

**Current weather (per district lat/lng):**
```
current=temperature_2m,relative_humidity_2m,apparent_temperature,
        precipitation,weather_code,wind_speed_10m,wind_direction_10m,
        surface_pressure,cloud_cover,uv_index
```

**Hourly (7-day forecast):**
```
hourly=temperature_2m,relative_humidity_2m,precipitation_probability,
       precipitation,weather_code,wind_speed_10m,cloud_cover,uv_index
```

**Daily (14-day):**
```
daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_sum,
      wind_speed_10m_max,uv_index_max,weather_code
```

**Air quality (per district):**
```
hourly=pm10,pm2_5,carbon_monoxide,nitrogen_dioxide,sulphur_dioxide,
       ozone,european_aqi,european_aqi_pm2_5,european_aqi_pm10
```

### District coverage strategy

Fetch weather for all 64 districts using their lat/lng centroid. The `District` table already has `name` — add `lat` and `lng` columns (average centroid per district) as part of the upazila/union seed task. Until then, hardcode centroids for the 8 divisional capitals as a starting point.

## What NOT to port from Java backends

| Java component | Reason to skip |
| --- | --- |
| Spring Modulith boundary enforcement | NestJS modules already provide this |
| Liquibase migrations | Prisma handles migrations |
| MapStruct DTO mapping | Use plain TypeScript mapper functions |
| Hibernate Spatial / JTS | PostGIS via Prisma raw queries when needed |
| Spring Security config | Already implemented as NestJS guards |
| JJWT library | Already using `@nestjs/jwt` |
| CompletableFuture async pattern | Native async/await |
| ApplicationEventPublisher | NestJS EventEmitter2 if needed, or direct service calls |
| Resilience4j annotations | Simple retry utility is enough |
| Swagger SpringDoc | @nestjs/swagger when OpenAPI is needed |

## Open questions before implementing ingestion

1. ~~**District lat/lng centroids**~~ — Resolved (2026-08-16): added directly to `District` (not Upazila/Union), backfilled from `open-nature`'s `district.csv` for all 64 districts.
2. **WAQI API key** — a free account is needed at `aqicn.org/data-platform/token/`. Should we register one for dev?
3. **Weather data retention** — how long to keep raw hourly/daily rows? OpenMeteo hourly data generates 64 × ~12/day ≈ 768 rows/day per table. No aggregation tables were built, so raw rows accumulate indefinitely until a retention policy is decided.
4. **External-call audit trail** — no `ApiCallLog` was built (see "Implementation status" above). Revisit if debugging OpenMeteo schema drift or rate-limit issues becomes hard without one.
