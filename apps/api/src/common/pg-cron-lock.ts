/**
 * Postgres session-level advisory locks for cron job deduplication.
 *
 * In a multi-instance deployment every @Cron handler fires on every instance.
 * `withCronLock` wraps a cron body so that only the instance that wins the
 * lock runs the job — the others log a debug message and return immediately.
 *
 * Advisory locks are connection-scoped: if the process crashes mid-job the
 * connection closes and Postgres releases the lock automatically, so there
 * is no risk of a permanent lock wedge.
 *
 * Key assignment: each cron job must have a unique integer in CRON_LOCK_KEYS.
 * Keys are arbitrary — pick any value that does not collide within this map.
